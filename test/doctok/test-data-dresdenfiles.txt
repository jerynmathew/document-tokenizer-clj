The Dresden Files

This article is about the series of books. For the television series, see The Dresden Files (TV series).

The Dresden Files is a series of contemporary fantasy/mystery novels written by Jim Butcher. The first novel, Storm Front, was published in 2000 by Roc Books. The books are written as a first person narrative from the perspective of the main character, private investigator and wizard Harry Dresden, as he recounts investigations into supernatural disturbances in modern-day Chicago.

Butcher’s original proposed title for the first novel was Semiautomagic, which sums up the series’ balance of fantasy and hard-boiled detective fiction. 

As of 2014, Butcher has written 15 novels set in the “Dresden Files” universe, plus a number of short stories (some of which are collected in the anthology Side Jobs). The series has also been released in audiobook format, narrated by James Marsters. Other works set in the same fictional universe include graphic novels (several new stories, plus adaptations of the first two novels), and The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game. In 2007, a television series based on the novels aired for one season on theAmerican Sci-Fi Channel.


1 Overview

Further information: The Dresden Files groups, The Dresden Files characters, and Laws of Magic (The Dresden Files)

In the world of The Dresden Files, magic is real, along with vampires, demons, spirits, faeries, werewolves, outsiders, and other monsters. Although the supernatural is still widely discredited, it is practiced by some members of society. Additionally, large portions of the globe (such as much of Central and South America) are mentioned as being largely under the control of supernatural factions. The White Council is an organization of human wizards, noted to wield significant economic power in the world, along with their supernatural power. Each species in the series (humans, faeries, vampires, etc.) has its own political and societal rules and organizations. The human wizards depend on the White Council, while faeries may belong to either of two Faerie Courts, or none at all. Vampires may belong to any of four vampire courts.

Harry Dresden works as the world’s only “consulting wizard”, accepting supernatural cases from both human and non-human clients, as well as the Chicago PD's Special Investigation unit. As the series progresses, Dresden takes on an increasingly important role in the supernatural world at large as he works to protect the general public, making it difficult for him to get by as a working wizard and private investigator. He finds himself facing off against an increasing variety of creatures (including other wizards), while facing the realization that his various cases may all be tied together behind the scenes and that his role might be even greater than he is willing to admit.

2 Publishing history

Jim Butcher decided to become a professional author at the age of nineteen. Subsequently he wrote three novels within the fantasy genre and one which he has classified as paranormal—books which the author has described as being “terrible”.  In 1996 he enrolled in a writing class where he was encouraged to write a novel similar to the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series by Laurell K. Hamilton, rather than the more traditional high fantasy that had been his focus in the past, as Butcher had previously stated that he enjoyed the Anita Blake series. Despite initial resistance, he wrote the first book that semester, closely following the instructions of his teacher, author Deborah Chester.


When I finally got tired of arguing with her and decided to write a novel as if I was some kind of formulaic, genre writing drone, just to prove to her how awful it would be, I wrote the first book of the Dresden Files. — Jim Butcher in “A Conversation with Jim Butcher”, 2004 

The result was Semiautomagic, later to be retitled as Storm Front. His writing teacher declared it to be publishable, and Butcher started hunting around to do just that.  Butcher failed to secure a publisher for two to three years. During this period he completed the second novel, Fool Moon, and had made significant progress on the third, Grave Peril. Deciding to focus on agents and editors whohad already published similar novels, Butcher targeted Ricia Mainhardt, the agent representing Laurell Hamilton, and submitted a copy of his manuscript. It was not accepted.  Finally, Butcher met Hamilton at a convention, and was invited to lunch along with Mainhardt and a second agent, Jennifer Jackson. Mainhardt agreed to represent him, and six months later The Dresden Files was sold to ROC, an imprint of Penguin Books.


The first volume, Storm Front, was released in 2000 in paperback; the next two novels in the series, Fool Moon and Grave Peril, were released shortly thereafter, in January and September 2001, also in paperback. Subsequent novels in the series have been published annually since then, with the most recent novel, Skin Game, published in May 2014. Omnibus editions have been released by the Science Fiction Book Club, with each of the four volumes reprinting two or three of the novels in the sequence.

The series’ first six novels were originally only published as paperbacks, but in 2007 ROC changed its strategy and began to publish hardcover reprints of books one to six. Volume six, Blood Rites, was released in July 2007. From book seven onward, each new book was directly published
as hardcover and paperback both. Orbit Books purchased the series for UK publication, and released the first novel, Storm Front in September 2005— five years after the initial US release. They then proceeded to publish two books per month. In November 2007, Orbit Books announced that they had purchased the rights to Changes, the twelfth novel, as well as the thirteenth Dresden novel, Ghost Story.


All 15 volumes of The Dresden Files, along with the companion short story anthology Side Jobs, have been released as audiobooks. Originally, all except Ghost Story have been narrated by James Marsters. Per a release on Jim Butcher’s website on June 27, 2011, he reported that, “due to scheduling conflicts”, James Marsters would be unable to voice Ghost Story; instead, the narration was performed by John Glover.  James Marsters returned to read the Cold Days audio book. In April 2015, a rerecorded version of “Ghost Story” read by James Marsters was released. The cover art for the series was created by Chris McGrath. On April 4, 2015, the World Science Fiction Society announced that Skin Game, the fifteenth installment in theseries, was a finalist for the 2015 Hugo Award for Best Novel.  Skin Game had been proposed as a nominee by
both fantasy writer Brad Torgersen’s "Sad Puppies"  and science fiction and fantasy author Theodore Beale's "Rabid Puppies" slates;  both “Puppy” slates engendered some controversy in the science fiction and fantasy community, since slate voting had not previously been a
publicized part of the Hugos. The book placed fifth in the final tally of the votes, behind “No Award”.

The Dresden Files was adapted to television in 2007 by the Sci-Fi Channel, and was canceled after one season.
3.2 Graphic novels
In October 2007, Jim Butcher announced on his website that Dabel Brothers would be producing a Dresden Files graphic novel series: 
Working together with Dabel Brothers Productions, the Dresden Files are going to be translated into a graphic novel format. The current plan is to lay out the Dresden Files storyline at the rate of one of the novels every twelve to sixteen monthly issues, with occasional sidetrips and independent stories thrown in. (Ever wonder what happened in Branson the month before Storm Front? How about what somebody saw in the lake in Minnesota between Storm Front and Fool Moon? Maybe I’ll get totell those stories now! How cool is that?) I will be assisting with the writing of the comics, and am also involved in the design and approval of the characters, art, tone, and soon. This is an actual hand-in-hand project in which I have full creative input and influence, and I’m friggin’ giddy about it. I mean, comeon! Comic books!

3.3 Roleplaying game
Main article: The Dresden Files Roleplaying Game
Jim Butcher has spoken openly about a pen and paper roleplaying game released in 2010 based on the Dresden Files universe. The game has been produced by Evil Hat Productions.

In January 2008, the project went into an early alpha phase of testing, and was in various beta testing phases throughout 2009. Pre-orders were opened up on April 4, 2010, and include immediate access to the pre-print PDF, dubbed the “Early Bird” version. Evil Hat released the game June 23–27, 2010, to coincide with Origins 2010. The RPG currently consists of two books, Volume One: Your Story, the core rule book, and Volume Two: Our World, a text describing the game universe.
The game, which uses a modified version of the FATE system, emphasizes narrative structure over simulation of magical physics. It allows players to play a wide variety of characters, ranging from an ordinary human such as Karrin Murphy or Gentleman Johnny Marcone to magic users like Harry Dresden or Molly Carpenter to powerful supernatural creatures along the lines of Thomas Raith, all in the same game, with all the players able to make a contribution. On release it won awards at the Origins Awards, the Golden Geek Awards, and the ENnies. A third book, the Paranet Papers, was released on June 1, 2015.
Evil Hat was working on a live-action version of the RPG, named Dresden Lives, but it was cancelled during beta testing.
